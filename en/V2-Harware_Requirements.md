## Security Verification Requirements

| # | Description | L1 | L2 | L3 |
| --  | ---------------------- | - | - | - |
| **2.1** | Verify that MCU supports disabling or protecting access to debugging interfaces (e.g. JTAG, SWD). | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **2.2** | Verify that the MCU provides code protection mechanisms such as write protect. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **2.3** | Verify that the MCU provides memory and I/O protection capabilities to limit access so that only privileged processes can access certain memory areas. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **2.4** | Verify that the MCU provides hardware based cryptographic functionality. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **2.5** | Verify that the MCU provides support for trusted execution environments. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **2.6** | Verify that sensitive data, private keys and certificates can be stored securely by leveraging dedicated hardware security features. Consider making use of a Secure Element, TPM or TEE (Trusted Execution Environment). | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **2.7** | Verify that the MCU provides protection against de-capping, side channel and glitching attacks. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **2.8** | Verify that sensitive traces are not exposed to outer layers of the printed circuit board. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
