# V1: IoT Ecosystem - Architecture Design Requirements

## Control Objective

## Security Verification Requirements

| # | Description | L1 | L2 | L3 |
| -- | ---------------------- | - | - | - |
| **1.1** | Verify that all components in the IoT application's ecosystem have been identified. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **1.2** | Verify that all connected devices within the IoT ecosystem can be uniquely identified. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **1.3** | Verify that the IoT ecosystem is designed in such a way that the impact of a compromise of one connected device is limited to that device only. I.e. assume that the connected device will be compromised at some point in time. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **1.4** | Verify that a mechanism exists to update connected devices. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **1.6** | Verify that a mechanism exists to securely decommission devices. I.e. make sure that sensitive information stored locally on the device can be removed. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **1.7** | Verify that all security controls have centralized implementations. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **1.8** | Verify that the supporting hardware platform for the connected devices is able to provide the required security level.  | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **1.9** | Verify that a responsible disclosure policy is in place. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| **1.10** | Verify that the IoT application complies with applicable laws and regulations. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
